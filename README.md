# Frontend Challenege

## Time estimages for all components


## Blog listing

Time estimate - 1 hour (it's a card that you can reuse)

- no hover state design
- blog posts aren't exactly center but look like they should be (143px right and 152px left)
- hard to tell pixels under 'blog' heading as text box is too big.
- is 12px accessible?
- I'd usually create a blogCard component and then loop over in blogListing but as this is static I've just put all 3 cards in blogListing.
- linear gradient was rotated 90 degrees so copying the code from the properties was wrong. Also not full height so had to guess %.

Time taken: 1 hour 13 minutes
